# ACM Research Coding Challenge (Fall 2020)

I am using pandas, numpy, matplotlib, and sklearn libary from python

This article helps me alot during my clustering coding challenge:

By using K-means clustering algorithm, I manage to divide the graph into 4 cluster. First, we need to scaled the data around zero mean. Then I draw a graph to determine number of cluster using Elbow method and matplotlib. Finally, I use matplotlib to visualize number of cluster.
