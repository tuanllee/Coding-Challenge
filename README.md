# ACM Research Coding Challenge (Fall 2020)

I am using pandas, numpy, matplotlib, and sklearn libary from python

This article helps me alot during my clustering coding challenge:
https://medium.com/code-to-express/k-means-clustering-for-beginners-using-python-from-scratch-f20e79c8ad00

By using K-means clustering algorithm, I manage to divide the graph into 4 cluster. First, we need to scaled the data around zero mean. Then I draw a graph to determine number of cluster using Elbow method and matplotlib. Finally, I use matplotlib to visualize number of cluster.




















## No Collaboration Policy

**You may not collaborate with anyone on this challenge.** You _are_ allowed to use Internet documentation. If you _do_ use existing code (either from Github, Stack Overflow, or other sources), **please cite your sources in the README**.

## Submission Procedure

Please follow the below instructions on how to submit your answers.

1. Create a **public** fork of this repo and name it `ACM-Research-Coding-Challenge`. To fork this repo, click the button on the top right and click the "Fork" button.
2. Clone the fork of the repo to your computer using . `git clone [the URL of your clone]`. You may need to install Git for this (Google it).
3. Complete the Challenge based on the instructions below.
4. Email the link of your repo to research@acmutd.co with the same email you used to submit your application. Be sure to include your name in the email.

## Question One

<br/>
Given the following dataset in `ClusterPlot.csv`, determine the number of clusters by using any clustering algorithm. **You're allowed to use any Python library you want to implement this**, just document which ones you used in this README file. Try to complete this as soon as possible.

Regardless if you can or cannot answer the question, provide a short explanation of how you got your solution or how you think it can be solved in your README.md file.
